Goal:

  *  The purpose of this project is to create a functional survey form similar to this: https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/

Demo:

Skills Used:

  *  HTML5
  *  CSS
  *  JS 

Project Specifications:

 *   Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header"
 *   You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here)
 *   Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar"
 *   You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link
 *   When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
 *   You can watch an embedded product video with id="video"
 *   Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form"
 *   Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address
 *   The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
 *   The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
 *   Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit"
 *   When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit)
 *   The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
 *   Your product landing page should have at least one media query
 *   Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once

Challenges Faced:

 *   making the site look decent was a big challenge in FIGMA (design is definitely not my strong point i can tell >_< )
 *   creating a separate responsive navbar on mobile took a minute for sure
 *   changing my mind in terms of styling over and over again
 *   organization issues in the stylesheet, strongly considering making multiple CSS files in future projects
 *   adding meaningful comments in the code, if i come back in a few months alot of things will probably not make sense

New Things Learned:

*    basic introduction into javascript for mobile hamburger menu
*    mobile first design
*    more indepth look into media queries
*    importing local fonts
